# 7-Heaven

Say welcome back to iOS 7.

7-Heaven brings back the "Free" button in the App Store for when the app is free. And that's not all! It replaces the button with its iOS 7 counterpart regardless of the text, discards the "In app purchases" text in favor of the little + sign and most importantly, **it works in every language seamlessly!**

_Note: this tweak is a fork of [Free Market by Zachary Thomas Paul](https://github.com/LacertosusRepo/Open-Source-Tweaks/blob/master/Free%20Market/)._
